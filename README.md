# Movie-Recommendation-System
A movie recommendation system built with React suggests movies based on user preferences. Users input their preferences, such as genre or rating, and the system displays recommended movies. React manages the user interface, updating movie suggestions in real-time. Each movie recommendation typically includes details like title, genre, and rating.
